🩺 Just completed Heart Disease Prediction ML Project! ❤️‍🔥
This project focuses on using Machine Learning in Healthcare to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on key medical features — and I’m super excited to share the outcome!

👨‍⚕️ Why this project?
Cardiovascular disease is one of the top causes of death globally. Early detection through data can save lives. I built this project to explore how data science and machine learning can assist in real-world health diagnostics.

🔬 Project Highlights:

📊 Dataset:
Used a realistic heart disease dataset with features like:

Age
Gender
Chest pain type
Cholesterol
Resting blood pressure
ECG results
Maximum heart rate
asting blood sugar
Exercise-induced angina

🧠 Modeling Techniques:
I trained and compared multiple models:

Logistic Regression (Primary model)
Support Vector Machine
Decision Tree
KNN💡 Achieved a solid accuracy by preprocessing the data, analyzing correlations, and visualizing trends using Seaborn & Matplotlib.

🧰 Tools & Libraries Used:
Python
pandas & numpy
seaborn & matplotlib
scikit-learn

📈 What I Learned:
✔ The importance of feature selection
✔ Handling categorical data
✔ Visualizing medical data for better insights
✔ How different ML algorithms perform on classification problems

Let’s use data to make healthcare smarter and more accessible! 🚀
